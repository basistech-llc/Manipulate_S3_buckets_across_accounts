# Manipulate_S3_buckets_across_accounts
Useful scripts to transfer data across AWS accounts.

The purpose of this repo is to hang some useful python scripts that were used to transfer data from one AWS account to another, and then to check that the buckets have identical objects in them.

This code was written and executed in July 2024 to move data from an unused AWS account to one that gets more mileage.
